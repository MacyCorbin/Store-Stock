# Store-Stock

* Bamazon will store inventory of stock by giving each item a unique id. 
* These items are divided into catagories.
* A database stores the ids, categories, price, and quantity. 
* A customer can buy several items in their purchase and they will be added to the total. 
* If their order exceeds the amount in stock a notification will show.
